	  <h2>Study Review</h2>

<p>I don't think I can finish my website assignment.</p>

<div>When writing this study review, I was struggling with my Figma Web Assignment. I had completed the design and wanted to turn it into a website, but I quickly realized that I couldnâ€™t find the typeface style codes. I also had no idea how to upload my own photos to the website. Since my project is a photography website, I placed many photos in my Figma file, but I felt lost when it came to coding them into the site.

I then decided to try using Anima to export my Figma page to HTML. Unfortunately, my laptop couldn't run Anima, probably due to limited storage space. I faced another issue as well: although I had arranged my Figma pages in order, the preview showed my second page appearing first. Luckily, the interactions worked as expected.

Through this process, I realized there are still many things I need to learn. Four days of lectures felt too short for me, but at least I now know how to create a very simple website like this one and understand some of the challenges involved.
